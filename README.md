Hi, I’m Nicolas. I am a lecturer in Real Estate Economics at UCL's Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction.
I’m mainly interested in research topics involving the effects of indoor air pollution on learning and productivity. 
I also am interested in using hyper local measurements of outdoors air pollution to study regulatory efficiency and the impacts of economic and human activity on air pollution.
I’m currently learning how to properly program and code in Python, but I'm always learning about anything and everything.
You can reach me at n.duran@ucl.ac.uk.
